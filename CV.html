<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<ul>
<li>B.Sc with First Class Honours and University Medal, Pure Mathematics, University of Sydney, 2008-2011.</li>
<li>PhD, Pure Mathematics, University of Michigan, 2012 - 2017. Specialized in category theory and representation theory.</li>
<li>I spend a lot of time thinking about:
<ul>
<li>Pure Mathematics: differential geometry, representation theory and category theory: I am particularly interested in the interaction between these subjects and physics. Recently, I have been thinking about the relationship between modular tensor categories, 3 dimensional topological quantum field theories and topological quantum computing.</li>
<li>Statistical Inference: discriminative and generative models, inference algorithms (MAP estimation, MCMC, variational methods): Machine learning is popular right now. I have been spending some time learning about the mathematical foundations of the subject. I don't know all the folklore that goes into building effective non linear classifiers, but I understand the meaning of words like neural network, autoencoder, generative model and KL-divergence.</li>
<li>Computer Science: UNIX, scripting languages, functional programming: I have been using GNU/Linux as my main operating system since 2012. I have been using scripting languages (Bash, Lua, Emacs Lisp, Python...) to automate boring things since 2014. I prefer functional programming, but when mutable state is required, I like languages with simple object systems like Python.</li>
