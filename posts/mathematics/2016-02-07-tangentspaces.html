    <h1 id="tangent-spaces">Tangent spaces</h1>
<p>In <a href="2016-01-31-whatisamanifold.html">the last post</a>, we defined manifolds. In this post we shall start building the infrastructure required to do calculus on manifolds.</p>
<h3 id="not-sheaves-again....">Not sheaves again....</h3>
<p>In the last post, we defined the sheaf of observables on a topological space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>: For each open set <span class="math inline">\(U \subseteq X\)</span>, define <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X(U)\)</span> to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field">algebra</a> of continuous functions <span class="math inline">\(U \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(U \subseteq V\)</span> are open sets, then restriction gives us an algebra homomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X(V) \to \mathcal{O}_X(U)\)</span>. Sheaves might seem pointless at this point, but they are one of the most important organizational tools in geometry, so it is important for us to write down a precise definition which we can refer to later. We will break the definition into two parts. Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a topological space. A <em>presheaf</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> consists of the following data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>for each open set <span class="math inline">\(U \subseteq X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(U)\)</span> is a <strong>set</strong></li>
<li>for each inclusion of open sets <span class="math inline">\(U \subseteq V\)</span>, we have a <strong>function</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(U \subseteq V) : \mathcal{F}(V) \to \mathcal{F}(U)\)</span> such that
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(U \subseteq U)\)</span> is the <strong>identity function</strong></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(W \subseteq U) \circ \mathcal{F}(U \subseteq V) = \mathcal{F}(W \subseteq V)\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In the language of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>, a presheaf is just a contravariant functor from the category of open sets in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, into the category of sets. If <span class="math inline">\(s \in \mathcal{F}(V)\)</span>, then we shall write <span class="math inline">\(s\lvert_U = \mathcal{F}(U \subseteq V)(s)\)</span> and call <span class="math inline">\(s \lvert_U\)</span> the restriction of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. The two conditions above state that <span class="math inline">\(s \lvert_V = s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((s \lvert_U) \lvert_W = s \lvert_W\)</span>, which are true for <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span>. We have really defined a presheaf of sets. To get the definition for a presheaf of vector spaces, make the following replacements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>set</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\longrightarrow\)</span> <strong>vector space</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>function</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\longrightarrow\)</span> <strong>linear transformation</strong></li>
<li><strong>identity function</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\longrightarrow\)</span> <strong>identity transformation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We can define a presheaf of algebras, a presheaf of groups or more generally, a presheaf in any category. The gadget <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span> is a presheaf of algebras. We have also seen another presheaf. Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a manifold. define <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_X(U)\)</span> to be the algebra of smooth functions <span class="math inline">\(U \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> (why can we add and multiply smooth functions?). In mathematics, the objects you study always have morphisms between them. For sets, there are functions, for vector spaces, there are linear transformations. Presheaves are no exception. If <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}\)</span> are presheaves on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, then a morphism <span class="math inline">\(\alpha : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}\)</span> of presheaves consists of</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For each open subset <span class="math inline">\(U \subseteq X\)</span>, a <strong>function</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_U : \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{G}(U)\)</span> such that
<ul>
<li>the following square commutes: <span class="math display">\[\require{AMScd}
                               \begin{CD}
                               \mathcal{F}(V) @&gt;{\alpha_V}&gt;&gt; \mathcal{G}(V);\\
                               @VVV @VVV \\
                               \mathcal{F}(U) @&gt;{\alpha_U}&gt;&gt; \mathcal{G}(U);
                               \end{CD}\]</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The vertical maps are just the restriction maps. In the language of category theory, a morphism of presheaves is just a natural transformation. We have a morphism of presheaves <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_X \to \mathcal{O}_X\)</span>. This is just a fancy way of saying that every smooth function is also a continuous function. Now we can define what a sheaf is. Given a presheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and an open covering <span class="math inline">\(V = \cup_{i} U_i\)</span> of the open set <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, we have the following function: <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{F}(V) \to \left\{ (s_i) \in \prod_i \mathcal{F}(U_i) : s_i \lvert_{U_i \cap U_j} = s_j \lvert_{U_i \cap U_j} \right\} \qquad s \mapsto (s \lvert_{U_i})\]</span> We call <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> a <em>sheaf</em> if this function is bijective for every open cover <span class="math inline">\(V = \cup_i U_i\)</span>. When you unravel the definitions, this means two things: Firstly, if two sections <span class="math inline">\(s,t \in \mathcal{F}(V)\)</span> are equal locally, then they are equal globally and if you have a bunch of compatible local sections, they glue to give a unique global section. If you have understood the definitions, it is routine to check that both <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_X\)</span> are sheaves. You just need to unravel the definitions. Also, a morphism of sheaves is just a morphism of the underlying presheaves. At this point, I could give a lot of contrived examples to try and explain these definitions, but that would be a mistake. As we progress deeper into differential geometry, we will see many many examples of sheaves arise organically. There is a fair amount more to say about abstract sheaves, but we shall develop the theory as it is needed.</p>
<h3 id="the-stalks-of-a-sheaf">The stalks of a sheaf</h3>
<p>Before we can start talking about the tangent bundle, we need one more abstract definition from sheaf theory. Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a space and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> a presheaf on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Fix <span class="math inline">\(p \in X\)</span>. We define the stalk <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}_p\)</span> as follows: <span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{F}_p = \cup_{p \in U} \mathcal{F}(U) / \sim \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f \sim g\)</span> if the elements <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> agree after restriction to some small neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (you should check that this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation">equivalence relation</a>). Elements of the stalk <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}_p\)</span> are called <span class="math inline">\(germs\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(f \in \mathcal{F}(U)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(p \in U\)</span>, then we write <span class="math inline">\(f_p\)</span> for the germ of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is a sheaf of vector spaces, or algebras, or groups, then the stalks inherit the same structure (you should check this!) If you know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_%28category_theory%29">colimits</a>, then a more precise definition of the stalk is <span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{F}_p = {\rm colim}_{p \in U} \mathcal{F}(U)\]</span> this is just a fancy way of encoding the definition I gave above.</p>
<h3 id="tangent-spaces-1">Tangent spaces!</h3>
<p>Now that we have developed the relevant abstraction, we can finally start doing some real mathematics! I don't expect that you have completely absorbed everything I said about sheaf theory, but whenever I use the word sheaf, germ or stalk, you should refer back to the definitions given in the previous two sections.</p>
<p>Everyone who has taken multi-variable calculus has some idea what a tangent plane is. Take for example <span class="math inline">\(S^2 = \{ (x,y,z) : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \}\)</span>. The tangent plane at a point <span class="math inline">\((a,b,c) \in S^2\)</span> is the plane which <em>touches</em> the sphere at (a,b,c) but does not cut the sphere:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../img/2016-02-07-spheretangentplane.PNG" alt />

</div>
<p>It is defined inside <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> by the equation <span class="math inline">\(ax + by + cz = 1\)</span>. The tangent plane is an example of a tangent space. There is a simpler example. Take the equation <span class="math inline">\(y = f(x)\)</span>. This defines a graph inside <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>. The tangent line at <span class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span> looks like:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../img/2016-02-07-tangentlinegraph.PNG" alt />

</div>
<p>The equation for the tangent line is <span class="math inline">\(y = f(a) + f'(a) x\)</span>. Now take a manifold <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. We want to define the tangent space at <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span>. There seems to be a problem: Our manifold <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> does not live inside Euclidean space, so we can't write down a formula which defines the tangent space. We can solve this problem by stepping back and thinking about what the tangent space at <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> really is. It should encode all the <em>directions</em> in which we can move if we are standing at the point <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is embedded in euclidean space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^d\)</span>, then it encodes all the <em>directions</em> which we can face when standing on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. This suggests a possible definition (which is wrong): A tangent vector at <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> is the germ of a smooth map <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : (-\epsilon,\epsilon) \to X\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(0) = x\)</span>. This captures all the <em>directions</em> we can move at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, but something is wrong. Consider the functions <span class="math display">\[\gamma_n(t) = (t,t^n) \qquad n \geq 2\]</span> none of these functions agree on any open neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-space, so by our definition, they all define different tangent vectors at <span class="math inline">\(0 \in \mathbb{R}^2\)</span>. However, suppose we graph the functions for <span class="math inline">\(t \in (-2^{-16},2^{-16})\)</span> using a computer. Then they all look exactly the same as <span class="math inline">\((t,0)\)</span>. For my intuitive definition of <em>direction</em>, it shouldn't matter if you zoom in. You should be able to distinguish directions regardless of your magnification. This suggests that <span class="math inline">\((t,0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((t,t^2)\)</span> should define the same direction at <span class="math inline">\(0 \in \mathbb{R}^2\)</span>. Now graph <span class="math inline">\((t,t)\)</span> on a computer for <span class="math inline">\(t \in (-2^{-16},2^{-16})\)</span>. It looks very different than <span class="math inline">\((t,0)\)</span>, regardless of how much you magnify! Therefore <span class="math inline">\((t,t)\)</span> should define a different direction to <span class="math inline">\((t,0)\)</span> at the point <span class="math inline">\(0 \in \mathbb{R}^2\)</span>. Let us update the definition: Tangent vectors at <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> are represented by germs of curves <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : (-\epsilon,\epsilon) \to X\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(0) = x\)</span>. Two such germs <span class="math inline">\(\gamma,\delta\)</span> represent the same tangent vector if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma'(0) = \delta'(0)\)</span>. In differential geometry, whenever you define something, you need to check that it does not depend on your choice of coordinates. In this case, the chain rule implies that if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma'(0) = \delta'(0)\)</span> in some coordinate system, then the equation is true in any coordinate system (you should check this!) Therefore our definition of tangent vector makes sense: It does not depend on our choice of coordinates. Let's explore the definition for our running example <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_n(t) = (t,t^n)\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(n \not= 1\)</span> we have that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_n'(0) = (1,0)\)</span>, but when <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1'(0) = (1,1)\)</span>. Note that the exact vectors you get here depend on your choice of coordinate system, but whether they are equal or not is coordinate independent.</p>
<p>We have defined the tangent space as a set: tangent vectors are represented by germs of curves, and two germs define the same tangent vector if they agree to first order (thanks to the chain rule, this doesn't depend on the choice of coordinates). We are missing some structure though. If you take a manifold inside euclidean space like the sphere, the tangent space is a linear space! Can you add tangent vectors represented by curves in a coordinate independent way? The answer is yes, but we shall see this in a slightly round about way. Recall that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_X\)</span> is the sheaf of smooth functions on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Given a tangent vector represented by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span>, we can define a function <span class="math inline">\(D : \mathcal{C}_{X,x} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> by the formula <span class="math display">\[D(f) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(\gamma(t))-f(x)}{t}\]</span> for this to make sense, there is a lot to check. Firstly, we need to check that it only depends on the germ of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and the germ of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. This follows because <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> appear inside the limit. Secondly we need to check that the formula only depends on <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> as a tangent vector. This follows from the chain rule. We call <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> a differential operator because</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is linear over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> satisfies the product rule: <span class="math inline">\(D(fg) = f(x) D(g) + g(x) D(f)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We have a function <span class="math display">\[T_x X \to \left\{ \text{Differential operators $\mathcal{C}_{X,x} \to \mathbb{R}$} \right\}\]</span> where by <span class="math inline">\(T_xX\)</span> we mean the set of tangent vectors represented by germs of curves. This function is bijective! Here is the proof. The domain, codomain and map depend only on a small open neighborhood around <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Therefore, after choosing coordinates, we can assume that <span class="math inline">\(X = \mathbb{R}^d = \mathbb{R}\{e_1,\dots,e_d\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>. Elements of the left hand side look like <span class="math display">\[ \gamma(t) = (a_1,\dots,a_d) t + O(t^2)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[ \delta(t) = (b_1,\dots,b_d) t + O(t^2)\]</span> The curves <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> represent the same tangent vector iff <span class="math inline">\((a_1,\dots,a_d) = (b_1,\dots,b_d)\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(D : \mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{R}^d,0} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> be a differential operator and fix <span class="math inline">\(f \in \mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{R}^d,0}\)</span>. There is a Taylor expansion <span class="math display">\[ f = a_1 x_1 + \dots + a_d x_d + \sum_{i \leq j} O(x_i x_j)\]</span> which implies that <span class="math display">\[D(f) = a_1 D(x_1) + \dots + a_d D(x_d)\]</span> Write <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> for the image of the tangent vector <span class="math inline">\(t e_i\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(D_i(f) = a_i\)</span>. This implies that <span class="math display">\[ D = D(x_1) D_1 + D(x_2) D_2 + \dots + D(x_d) D_d. \]</span> It is easy to see that the codomain is a vector space. We have just proved that the operators <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> span. They are linearly independent because <span class="math inline">\(D_i(x_j) = \delta_{ij}\)</span>. It follows from the chain rule that <span class="math display">\[ (a_1,\dots,a_d) t \mapsto \sum_i a_i D_i \]</span> this completes the proof. We call the image of a tangent vector <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, the directional derivative along <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. At this point, we should stop and slightly update our intuitive definition of the tangent space at <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span>. It encodes all the <em>directions</em> you could face and also the possible <em>speeds</em> in which you could move. Given a coordinate chart <span class="math inline">\(y_1,\dots,y_d\)</span> around <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span>, we get a basis <span class="math display">\[ T_xX = \mathbb{R} \left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial y_1} \lvert_x, \dots, \frac{\partial}{\partial y_d} \lvert_x \right\} \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\partial / \partial y_i \lvert_x\)</span> takes <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, differentiates with respect to <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> and then evaluates at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
