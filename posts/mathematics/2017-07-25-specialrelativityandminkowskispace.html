    <h1 id="special-relativity-and-minkowski-space">Special Relativity and Minkowski Space</h1>
<p>If we measure the speed of light in a vacuum, we always get the same value, independent of the velocity of the light source. The speed of light is a universal constant. This fact has several interesting qualitative consequences. Firstly, choose units so that the speed of light is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Then the time taken for light to travel from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is equal to the distance between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Secondly, since we learn about the objects around us from the light which bounces of them, we expect our perception of these objects to be distorted if they are moving close to the speed of light. We are going to develop a quantitative understanding of this distortion.</p>
<h3 id="spacial-distortion-perpendicular-to-velocity">Spacial distortion perpendicular to velocity</h3>
<p>Before we can derive any formulas, we need to understand how spatial measurements get distorted perpendicular to velocity. Suppose that you have a square sheet of metal and you cut out a complicated shape from the middle:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../img/2017-07-25-no-perpendicular-dilation.PNG" alt />

</div>
<p>The cut out piece fits perfectly through the hole in the sheet. When objects are moving really fast, their size doesn’t change, just our perception of their size does. If the cut out piece is moving fast, parallel to the normal vector of the sheet (which is at rest in our frame of reference), it still fits through the hole. Therefore there cannot be any distortion of distances perpendicular to the velocity.</p>
<h3 id="the-spacetime-interval">The Spacetime Interval</h3>
<p>Since the time taken for light to travel from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is equal to the distance between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> (in our units), we can use light beams to construct a clock. Consider the following apparatus at rest:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../img/2017-07-25-clockatrest.PNG" alt />

</div>
<p>It takes time <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> for the light to travel from the bottom plate to the top plate. Now suppose that the clock is moving horizontally in your reference frame:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../img/2017-07-25-clockinmotion.PNG" alt />

</div>
<p>It takes time <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> for the light to travel from the bottom plate to the top plate in your reference frame. In the clocks reference frame, it takes time <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> for the light to travel from the bottom plate to the top plate. Since distances don’t get distorted perpendicular to the velocity, Pythagoras’s theorem tells us <span class="math display">\[l^2 - x^2 = d^2.\]</span> If we are watching an object traveling at a constant velocity, the time measured by a clock strapped to the object is <span class="math display">\[\sqrt{t^2 - x^2}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the time measured by our clock and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the distance which the object travels in our reference frame. This quantity is called a <strong>spacetime interval</strong> and the value is independent from the frame in which it was measured.</p>
<h3 id="minkowski-space">Minkowski Space</h3>
<p>Postulating that the speed of light is a universal constant forces us to unify space and time. To deal with this, we treat the time coordinate <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and the spatial coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> as coordinates on spacetime or Minkowski space <span class="math inline">\(M \cong \mathbb{R}^4\)</span>. Minkowski space is not just a bare <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-manifold. We also want to capture the spacetime interval which is independent of reference frame. If we see an object traveling with tangent vector <span class="math display">\[s \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + a \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + b \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + c \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\]</span> then the square of the spacetime interval <span class="math display">\[s^2 - a^2 - b^2 - c^2\]</span> is independent of reference frame. Therefore, we should equip <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with the symmetric <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-cotensor <span class="math display">\[dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2\]</span> called the Minkowski metric. It is important to understand the subgroup of <span class="math inline">\({\rm GL}(M)\)</span> preserving the Minkowski metric. We call this subgroup the <strong>Lorentz group</strong>. The Lie algebra of the Lorentz group has basis <span class="math display">\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \;
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \;
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \;
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \;
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \;
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]</span> The last three basis vectors span the Lie algebra for rotations of the spatial coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span>. The interesting vectors are the first three. The <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-parameter subgroup generated by the first vector is <span class="math display">\[
\begin{pmatrix}
{\rm cosh}(t) &amp; {\rm sinh}(t) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
{\rm sinh}(t) &amp; {\rm cosh}(t) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]</span> If we make the substitution <span class="math display">\[v = {\rm tanh}(t) = \frac{{\rm sinh}(t)}{{\rm cosh}(t)}\]</span> then the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-parameter subgroup becomes <span class="math display">\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2}} &amp; \frac{v}{\sqrt{1-v^2}} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 \frac{v}{\sqrt{1-v^2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2}} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]</span> This is the standard form for the Lorentz transformation.</p>
