<h1 id="vector-field-flow">Vector Field Flow</h1>
<p>In the <a href="2016-03-27-thejacobianmatrix.html">last post</a>, we finally explained how to differentiate a smooth map between manifolds, justifying the phrase <em>a manifolds is a space on which one can do calculus</em>. We have only scratched the surface. There is much more to say about manifolds. Before we can go deeper, we need a better understanding of vector fields. Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a manifold. Recall that a vector field is a section of the <a href="2016-02-28-thetangentbundle.html">tangent bundle</a> <span class="math inline">\(TX\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(x^1,\dots,x^d\)</span> are coordinates on <span class="math inline">\(U \subseteq X\)</span>, then the vector fields on <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> look like <span class="math display">\[f^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\]</span> (we are using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation">Einstein summation convention</a>). One way to construct vector fields on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is by describing them on coordinate patches and checking that they change coordinates correctly. For example, consider the coordinates <span class="math inline">\(\theta : S^1 \backslash \{ (1,0) \} \to (0,2 \pi)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi : S^1 \backslash \{ (-1,0) \} \to (-\pi,\pi)\)</span>.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\(d \phi / d \theta = 1\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(d / d \theta = d / d \phi\)</span> where both vector fields are defined. Therefore we have a globally defined vector field which we call <span class="math inline">\(d / d \theta\)</span>. If you need many coordinate charts to cover your manifold, then constructing vector fields in this way can be very time consuming.</p>
<h3 id="local-group-actions">Local group actions</h3>
<p>Consider the manifold <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. The addition map <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, (x,y) \mapsto x + y\)</span> is smooth. That means that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group">Lie group</a>. Lie groups are the most important objects in differential geometry and we will study them in general later, but for now let us just focus on the real line. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a manifold, we can talk about smooth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action">group actions</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R} \times X \to X\)</span>. Remember that group actions satisfy the following laws: <span class="math display">\[s \cdot (t \cdot x) = (s + t) \cdot x \qquad 0 \cdot x = x\]</span> Often in differential geometry, asking for group actions defined for all <span class="math inline">\(t \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> is too much. Instead, we talk about local group actions <span class="math inline">\((-\epsilon,\epsilon) \times X \to X\)</span> which are defined for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in an open neighborhood of the identity. We still require the same laws as a total group action, but only when the equations make sense. Every local group action of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> gives a vector field defined by <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto t \cdot x\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, consider the action <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R} \times S^1 \to S^1\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(t \cdot (\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = (\cos (\theta + t),\sin(\theta + t))\)</span>. In coordinates, the action is given by <span class="math inline">\(t \cdot \theta = \theta + t\)</span>. Since <span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dt}_{t=0} (\theta + t) = 1\]</span> it follows that the vector field corresponding to this action is <span class="math inline">\(d/d\theta\)</span>. Therefore, we have constructed <span class="math inline">\(d/d\theta\)</span> globally by defining a group action rather than by patching local vector fields together.</p>
<h3 id="every-vector-field-comes-from-a-local-group-action">Every vector field comes from a local group action</h3>
<p>Constructing vector fields from local group actions is nice. The amazing fact is that every vector field can be constructed in this way. This is our second example of an integrability result (the first example was <a href="2016-03-27-thejacobianmatrix.html">the inverse function theorem</a>). Let <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> be a vector field on the manifold <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For each <span class="math inline">\(p \in X\)</span>, we want to construct a curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_p(t) \in X\)</span> defined for <span class="math inline">\(t \in (-\epsilon,\epsilon)\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[\gamma_p'(t) = V(\gamma_p(t)) \qquad \gamma_p(0) = p\]</span> Choose a coordinate chart <span class="math inline">\(x^1,\dots,x^d\)</span> around <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p = (0,\dots,0)\)</span>. If we write <span class="math inline">\(V = f^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\)</span>, then we are faced with the following initial value problem: <span class="math display">\[{\bf x}'(t) = {\bf f}({\bf x}(t)) \qquad {\bf x}(0) = 0\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is smooth, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f_theorem">Picard-Lindelof theorem</a> from functional analysis tells us that there is a unique solution defined for <span class="math inline">\(t \in (-\epsilon,\epsilon)\)</span>. These curves give us a map <span class="math inline">\((-\epsilon,\epsilon) \times X \to X\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\((t,x) \mapsto \gamma_x(t)\)</span>. By definition, <span class="math inline">\(0 \cdot x = \gamma_x(0) = x\)</span>. Also, since solutions are unique, we must have <span class="math display">\[\gamma_{\gamma_x(s)}(t) = \gamma_x(t+s)\]</span> which translates to <span class="math inline">\(t \cdot (s \cdot x) = (t+s) \cdot x\)</span>. This local group action is often called the flow of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. We shall often use the notation <span class="math inline">\(L_{t,V}(x) = t \cdot x\)</span>. In words, <span class="math inline">\(L_{t,V}(x)\)</span> flows the point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> along the vector field <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> seconds.</p>
<h3 id="lie-derivatives">Lie Derivatives</h3>
<p>Now that we know every vector field comes from a local group action of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, we can start doing some tricky things with vector fields. Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a manifold, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> a vector field and <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> a smooth function. Then <span class="math display">\[V(f) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{L_{t,V}^* f -f}{t}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(L_{t,V}^* f(x) = f(L_{t,V}(x)) = f(t \cdot x)\)</span>. This formula is not new. We already discussed it in the <a href="2016-02-07-tangentspaces.html">tangent spaces</a> post. Motivated by this, we can do something which is new. Let <span class="math inline">\(U,V\)</span> be vector fields. Then define <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{L}_V U = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{U - L_{t,V}'(U) }{t}\]</span> This is a vector field on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> called the Lie derivative of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> along <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. We can compute <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_V U\)</span> as follows: <span class="math display">\[(\mathcal{L}_V U)_x(f) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{U_x(f) - L'_{t,V}(U_{L_{-t,V}x})(f)}{t} 
= \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{U_x(f)-U_{L_{-t,V}x}L^*_{t,V} f}{t} = \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{U_x(f)-U_{L_{-t,V}x}(f) + U_{L_{-t,V}x}(f) - 
U_{L_{-t,V}x}L^*_{t,V} f}{t} = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{Uf(x) - L_{-t,V}^* Uf(x)}{t} + 
\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{U_{L_{-t,V}x}(f - L_{t,V}^*f)}{t} = V_xUf - U_x Vf\]</span> More cleanly, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_V U = VU - UV = [V,U]\)</span>. This makes sense because the commutator of two derivations is a derivation. We call <span class="math inline">\([V,U]\)</span> the Lie bracket. If <span class="math inline">\(x^1,\dots,x^d\)</span> are coordinates on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math display">\[V = f^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \qquad U = g^j \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\]</span> then <span class="math display">\[ [V,U] = \left( f^i \frac{\partial g^k}{\partial x^i} - g^j \frac{\partial 
f^k}{\partial x^j} \right) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k} \]</span></p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-lie-bracket-mean">What does the Lie bracket mean?</h3>
<p>It is tempting to say things like <em><span class="math inline">\([V,U]\)</span> is the rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> in the direction of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span></em>. This is not correct. The vector <span class="math inline">\([V,U]_x\)</span> is not determined by <span class="math inline">\(V_x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. You need to know both <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> in an open neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. In fact, without further structure, there is no way to define the rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> along <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> in a coordinate independent way. What <span class="math inline">\([V,U]\)</span> really measures is the obstruction to the local group actions for <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> commuting with each other. We will make this precise when we start thinking about Lie theory, but we can understand it intuitively now. From the definition of the Lie derivative, we have <span class="math display">\[[tV,sU] = sU - L'_{t,V}(sU) \qquad \mod t^2,s^2.\]</span> This equation is encoded in the following cartoon:</p>

<h3 id="frobeniuss-theorem">Frobenius's Theorem</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a manifold and <span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq TX\)</span> a rank <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> sub bundle of the tangent bundle. We call the coordinate chart <span class="math inline">\(x^1,\dots,x^d\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> adapted to <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\partial / \partial x_1, \dots, \partial / \partial x_r\)</span> are a basis for <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. The Frobenius theorem says that we can cover <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with coordinate patches adapted to <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is closed under the Lie bracket. This is the third integrability result we have encountered! The Frobenius theorem will be important later, but its role in this post is to demonstrate that the Lie bracket contains interesting geometric information about <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. The proof is by induction on <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(r = 1\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq TX\)</span> is a line bundle. Fix <span class="math inline">\(p \in X\)</span>. Then we can choose coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x^1,\dots,x^d\)</span> around <span class="math inline">\(p \in U \subseteq X\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(E \lvert_U\)</span> is spanned by the nowhere vanishing vector field <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. Consider the local action <span class="math inline">\(a : \mathbb{R} \times U \dashrightarrow U\)</span> generated by <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> (we use the dashed arrow to indicate that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is only defined in an open neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(\{ 0 \} \times U\)</span>). The jacobian <span class="math inline">\(a'_{(0,0)}\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(V_p \not= 0\)</span> in the first column and a <span class="math inline">\(d \times d\)</span> identity matrix in the last <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> columns. By permuting the <span class="math inline">\(x^i\)</span>, we can assume that the first <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> columns of <span class="math inline">\(a'_{(0,0)}\)</span> are invertible. The inverse function theorem implies that <span class="math inline">\(t,x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}\)</span> are coordinates in a small neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> via the map <span class="math inline">\((t,x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}) \mapsto a(t,x_1,\dots,x_{d-1},0)\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(V = \partial / \partial t\)</span> in this coordinate chart. Since our choice of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> was arbitrary, we can cover <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with charts adapted to <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now assume that <span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq TX\)</span> is a rank <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> sub bundle. Fix <span class="math inline">\(p \in X\)</span>. We can choose an open subset <span class="math inline">\(p \in U \subseteq X\)</span> and vector fields <span class="math inline">\(V_1,\dots,V_r\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> which are a basis for <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> at each point in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. By shrinking <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, we can choose coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x^1,\dots,x^d\)</span> around <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(V_r = \partial / \partial x_1\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(j &lt; r\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[V_j = f^i_j \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\]</span> By changing basis on <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> (doing column operations), we can assume that <span class="math inline">\(f_j^1 = 0\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(j &lt; r\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be the sub bundle on <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> spanned by <span class="math inline">\(V_1,V_2,\dots,V_{r-1}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is closed under the Lie bracket, <span class="math inline">\(f_j^1 = 0\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is closed under the Lie bracket. By induction, we can shrink <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> to a smaller neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and find coordinates <span class="math inline">\(y^i\)</span> such that for <span class="math inline">\(j &lt; r\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(V_j = \partial / \partial y^j\)</span> and <span class="math display">\[V_r = f^i \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}\]</span> By changing basis on <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> again, we have <span class="math inline">\(f^i = 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i &lt; r\)</span>. If we shrink <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> to a smaller neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and permute <span class="math inline">\(y^{r},y^{r+1},\dots,y^d\)</span>, we can assume that <span class="math inline">\(f^r\)</span> does not vanish on <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. If we redefine <span class="math inline">\(V_r = V_r / f^r\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[V_r = \frac{\partial}{\partial y^r} + \sum_{i &gt; r} f^i \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i} 
\]</span> which implies <span class="math display">\[[V_j,V_r] = \sum_{k &gt; r} \frac{\partial f^k}{\partial y^j} \frac{\partial}{\partial 
y^k}\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is integral, this Lie bracket is a section of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> which implies that it equals <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(f^i\)</span> only depends on <span class="math inline">\(y^r,y^{r+1},\dots,y^d\)</span>. By the <span class="math inline">\(r=1\)</span> case, we can shrink <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> to a smaller neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and replace the coordinates <span class="math inline">\(y^r,y^{r+1},\dots,y^d\)</span> with coordinates <span class="math inline">\(z^r,z^{r+1},\dots,z^d\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(V_r = \partial / \partial z^r\)</span>. This completes the proof!</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is closed under the Lie bracket, we call it integrable. The Frobenius theorem says that if <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is an integrable subbundle, then it is the union of the tangent bundles of interleaved sub manifolds. This should be geometrically obvious in the case of a nowhere vanishing vector field, but it is harder to visualize in the higher dimensional case.</p>
