<h1 id="symmetry-in-physical-law">Symmetry in Physical Law</h1>
<p>Symmetry plays an important role in physics. In order to make things precise, we need language for talking about the symmetry groups of differential equations. In this post, we shall develop this language and look at some simple examples.</p>
<h3 id="jet-bundles">Jet Bundles</h3>
<p>To keep things simple, we work locally. Consider a manifold <span class="math inline">\(N^n\)</span> with coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x^i\)</span> and a manifold <span class="math inline">\(D^d\)</span> with coordinates <span class="math inline">\(u^{\alpha}\)</span>. We call <span class="math inline">\(x^i\)</span> the <strong>independent</strong> variables and <span class="math inline">\(u^{\alpha}\)</span> the <strong>dependent</strong> variables. We want to study maps <span class="math inline">\(N \to D\)</span>. The graphs of such maps are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional closed submanifolds of <span class="math inline">\(N \times D\)</span> which has coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x^i,u^{\alpha}\)</span>. Another name for the product manifold <span class="math inline">\(N \times D\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-jet bundle. We construct the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-jet bundle locally as follows: It has coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x^i,u_I^{\alpha}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is a weakly increasing sequence in <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\)</span> with length <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq l \leq p\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(I = i_1 \leq i_2 \leq \dots \leq i_q\)</span>, the coordinate <span class="math inline">\(u_I^{\alpha}\)</span> is supposed to record the partial derivative <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial^q u^{\alpha}}{\partial x^{i_1} \partial x^{i_2} \cdots \partial x^{i_q}}.\]</span> For example, take <span class="math inline">\(n = 1, d = 2\)</span>. Then the coordinates on the second jet bundle are <span class="math display">\[x,u,v,u_x,v_x,u_{xx},v_{xx}.\]</span> If we take <span class="math inline">\(n = 2, d = 1\)</span>, the coordinates on the second jet bundle are <span class="math display">\[x,y,u,u_x,u_y,u_{xx},u_{xy},u_{yy}.\]</span> Every map <span class="math inline">\(f : N \to D\)</span> induces an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional submanifold <span class="math inline">\(G_f = (x^i,f_I^{\alpha}(x^i))\)</span> in the jet bundle. The <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-form <span class="math display">\[\theta_I^{\alpha} = d u^{\alpha}_I - u^{\alpha}_{I i} d x^i\]</span> vanishes on the submanifold <span class="math inline">\(G_f\)</span> for every <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. We call <span class="math inline">\(\theta_I^{\alpha}\)</span> a <strong>contact ideal</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="lifting-infinitesimal-symmetries-to-the-jet-bundle">Lifting infinitesimal symmetries to the jet bundle</h3>
<p>Suppose that we have a vector field <span class="math display">\[X = f^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} + \phi_I^{\alpha} \frac{\partial}{\partial u^{\alpha}_I}\]</span> on the jet bundle. We want this infinitesimal symmetry to send the graph <span class="math inline">\(G_a\)</span> into a graph <span class="math inline">\(G_b\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a tangent vector to <span class="math inline">\(G_a\)</span>, then we have <span class="math display">\[\theta_I^{\alpha} (t \cdot V) = \theta_I^{\alpha}(V) + t \mathcal{L}_X \theta_I^{\alpha} (V) + \frac{t^2}{2} \mathcal{L}_X \mathcal{L}_X \theta_I^{\alpha}(V) + \dots\]</span> which will vanish if <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_X \theta_I^{\alpha}\)</span> is a smooth linear combination of the contact forms. We have <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{L}_X \theta_I^{\alpha} = d \phi_I^{\alpha} - \phi^{\alpha}_{I i} d x^i - u^{\alpha}_{I i} d f^i.\]</span> If you expand out the exterior derivatives and use the equation <span class="math inline">\(du_I^{\alpha} = \theta_I^{\alpha} + u_{I i}^{\alpha} dx^i\)</span>, then you get the equation <span class="math display">\[
\phi^{\alpha}_{I i} = \frac{\partial \phi_I^{\alpha}}{\partial x^i} - u^{\alpha}_{I j} \frac{\partial f^j}{\partial x^i} + u^{\beta}_{K i} \left( \frac{\partial \phi^{\alpha}_I}{\partial u^{\beta}_K} - u_{I j}^{\alpha} \frac{ \partial f^j}{ \partial u^{\beta}_K} \right)
\]</span> This is a complicated formula, so let us look at it when <span class="math inline">\(n = d = 1\)</span>. In this case, <span class="math display">\[
\phi_{I1} = \frac{\partial \phi_I}{\partial x} - u_{I1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + u_1 \left( \frac{\partial \phi_I}{\partial u} - u_{I1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} \right) + u_{11} \left( \frac{\partial \phi_I}{\partial u_1} - u_{I1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_1} \right) + \dots
\]</span> If we suppose that both <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> only depend on <span class="math inline">\(x,u\)</span>, then we get <span class="math display">\[
\phi_1 = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} - u_1 \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + u_1 \left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial u} - u_1 \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} \right)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\phi_{11} = \frac{\partial \phi_1}{\partial x} - u_{11} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + u_1 \left( \frac{\partial \phi_1}{\partial u} - u_{11} \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} \right) + u_{11} \left( \frac{\partial \phi_1}{\partial u_1} - u_{11} \frac{\partial f}{\partial u_1}\right)
\]</span> expanding out these equations gives <span class="math display">\[
\phi_1 = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} - u_1 \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + u_1 \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial u} - u_1^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial u}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\phi_{11} = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} - u_1 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + 2 u_1 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x \partial u} - 2 u_1^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial u} - 2 u_{11} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + u_1^2 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial u^2} - u_1^3 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial u^2} - 3 u_{11} u_1 \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} + u_{11} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial u}
\]</span> As you can see, these computations are quite tedious.</p>
<h3 id="symmetry-groups-for-partial-differential-equations">Symmetry groups for Partial Differential Equations</h3>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a manifold and we have a smooth hypersurface <span class="math inline">\(H \subset M\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(F(m) = 0\)</span>. A vector field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> preserves <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(X(F) \lvert_H = 0\)</span>. Since partial differential equations are submanifolds of jet bundles, we can apply this idea to compute the symmetry groups for partial differential equations. This is best demonstrated via an example. Consider the partial differential equation <span class="math inline">\(u_{xx} = 0\)</span> which corresponds to a free particle in 1-dimensional space. We can lift the vector field <span class="math display">\[
X = f \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \phi \frac{\partial}{\partial u}
\]</span> to the second jet bundle using the formulas from the previous section. Preserving the submanifold <span class="math inline">\(u_{xx} = 0\)</span> means that we need <span class="math inline">\(0 = \phi_{11} \lvert_{u_{xx} = 0}\)</span>. Expanding this out means that <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} - u_1 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + 2 u_1 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x \partial u} - 2 u_1^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial u}  + u_1^2 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial u^2} - u_1^3 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial u^2} = 0
\]</span> Since this equation must hold for all <span class="math inline">\(u_1\)</span>, we get the following four partial differential equations: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} = 0
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial u^2} = 0
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 2 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x \partial u}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial u^2} = 2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial u}
\]</span> I am not sure how to solve these equations in general, but we can use them to verify that specific transformations are symmetries of <span class="math inline">\(u_{xx} = 0\)</span>. For example, take <span class="math inline">\((x,u) \mapsto (x,u + xv)\)</span>. This transformation is generated by the vector field <span class="math inline">\(x \partial / \partial u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f = 0, \phi = x\)</span> is a solution to the above equations.</p>
<h3 id="a-more-complete-example">A more complete example</h3>
<p>Consider the differential equation <span class="math inline">\(u_{xx} = - u\)</span>. An infinitesimal symmetry must satisfy the equation <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} - u_1 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + 2 u_1 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x \partial u} - 2 u_1^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial u} + 2 u \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + u_1^2 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial u^2} - u_1^3 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial u^2} + 3 u u_1 \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} - u \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial u} + \phi = 0
\]</span> which gives us the following equations: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} = - \phi
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 2 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x \partial u}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial u} = 2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial u^2} = 0
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 0
\]</span> Notice that the original differential equation appears in this list. This is because <span class="math inline">\(u_{xx} = - u\)</span> is linear, so the solution space is a vector space. Indeed, the general solution for this set of equations is <span class="math display">\[
f = A \qquad \phi = B \sin(x) + C \cos(x).
\]</span> Therefore, a basis for the Lie algebra of the symmetry group is <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \qquad \sin(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial u} \qquad \cos(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial u}.
\]</span></p>
