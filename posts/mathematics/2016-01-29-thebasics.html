<h1 id="the-basics">The basics</h1>
<p>I am going to use this blog to record some of my mathematical thoughts. Modern mathematics has a pretty steep learning curve and I don't really want to spend my time writing about the <em>basics</em>. What are the <em>basics</em>? I could say something like <em>everything you learn in a standard mathematics undergraduate degree</em>, but that is vague. On this site we shall use the following convention: <em>basic</em> mathematics is the material contained in the Appendices of <a href="https://www.math.washington.edu/~lee/Books/ISM/">Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</a> by John M Lee. I don't have any strong opinions about the book as a whole, but the Appendices line up closely with what I would call <em>basic</em> mathematics and they are very well organized. From these <em>basics</em>, you can develop a lot of interesting mathematics in a relatively short time period.</p>
